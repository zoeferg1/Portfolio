<h2 style="text-align:left;font-family:papyrus";> Coding Experience </h2>
<div id="block">
  <p>Before participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, Zo&euml; had very little coding experience.
    She participated in one of the Girls Who Code clubs, but only for a couple weeks and barely got to scratch the surface.
     She is excited to have the opportunity to learn how to code alongside all the other awesome girls at GWC EA!

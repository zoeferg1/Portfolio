<h2> Coding Experience </h2>
<div id="block">
  <p>Before participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, Zo&euml; had very little coding experience.
    She participated in one of the Girls Who Code clubs, but only for a couple weeks and barely got to scratch the surface.
     She is excited to have the opportunity to learn how to code alongside all the other awesome girls at GWC EA!

  <h3> <br> Day #6 </h3>
    <p> 7/5/17 <br>
      Zo&euml; started learning how to use Python! By the end of the day, she was successfully able to draw a shape by writing code, and even went a step further by having user input define how many sides the shape should be.

    <h3> <br> Day #8 </h3>
        <p> 7/7/17 <br>
          Zo&euml; successfully added a filter to her Half Dome picture by changing the intensity of the colors in the image. It was very difficult, but by the end of the day she was finally able to wrap her brain around the process, and get her image to change color.
